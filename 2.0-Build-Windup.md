## Building Windup

Before the first build, one must first install included jars bundled with Windup by executing:
* `mvn initialize`

To build the windup artifact from the source, execute the following:
* `mvn clean package`

## Installing Windup
The `windup-cli/target/windup-cli-x.y.z-bin/` (where x.y.z is the version) directory will contained the compiled Windup application bundled with all its dependencies.  The windup-cli.jar in the target folder does not contain all the dependencies and will throw a ClassNotFoundException if used.

The directory structure is important, since it sets up Windup's ClassPath.
