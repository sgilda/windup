What is a ruleset?
------------------

A ruleset is a Windup "plug-in" targetting a specific area of migration (e.g. Spring to Java EE 6 migration). Underhood, it is a set of rules, and everything they might need: link: Operations and link: Conditions, link: Report templates (if needed), and  static files (e.g. images, XML or CSV files, etc.).
A ruleset may also declare metadata, like ruleset ID, link: dependencies on other rulesets, etc.

link: Java-based ruleset is a link: Forge addon (i.e. a `.jar` file). link:

Groovy-based ruleset is a directory with `.windup.groovy` script(s) and its static files, possibly in a `.zip` file.
