What is a ruleset?
------------------

A ruleset is a Windup "plug-in" targetting a specific area of migration, knowledge,
 a group of rules, link: Operations and link: Conditions, along with link: Report templates (if needed), and  static files (e.g. images, XML or CSV files, etc.).

link: Java-based ruleset is a link: Forge addon (i.e. a `.jar` file). link: Groovy-based ruleset is a directory with `.windup.groovy` script(s) and its static files, possibly in a `.zip` file.

A ruleset may declare metadata, like ruleset ID, link: dependencies on other rulesets, etc.
