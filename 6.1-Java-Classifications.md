Within the Windup report, the high level report will show files within archives and the file's classification.  Below is how this is represented in the report.

```xml
<windup:java-classification 
   source-type="INHERITANCE" 
   regex="javax.ejb.EJBObject$"
   description="EJB 1.x/2.x - Remote Interface" />
```

A Java file is classified by identifiers in the Java file itself.  The Windup engine helps make classifying and putting inline hints in Java files much easier.  With a simple Regular Expression, you can add Java classifications based on characteristics of the Java file.  

##Important Note
JBoss Windup must blacklist the classes in order to provide Java hints and classifications.  The package blacklist can be found in: /windup-engine/src/main/resources/jboss-windup-context.xml within the bean blacklistedClasses.  The blacklist drives whether the class members are parsed and sent down the pipeline.  They all represent regular expressions.  Example: <value>com.bea</value> actually blacklists all classes ^com.bea.*.

###Example

The simple XML below (included in windup-java-ejb-config.xml) shows how the Java file depicted above was classified as "EJB 2.x - Local Object".  

```xml
<windup:java-classification source-type="INHERITANCE" regex="javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject$"
	description="EJB 2.x - Local Object" />
```

Attributes on the Java Classification include ([windup.xsd](https://github.com/jboss-windup/windup/blob/master/src/main/resources/namespace/windup.xsd)):
* **description** (string) - the classification to define the Java if the Regex matches
* **effort** (int) - number of Story Points to implement estimated changes
* **regex** (regex) - regular expression to match against
* **source-type** (enum | optional) - filter to apply regex to only certain Java class uses

The Java Classification can also include children tags:
* **windup:hints** - described below; provide inline hints to the Windup resource report.
* **windup:decorators** - described below; provide capability to chain logic.

###Source Type
The source-type can be:
* **METHOD** - regexPattern is only matched against method calls.
* **INHERITANCE** - regexPattern is only matched and the hint applied against the class "extends" or "implements" types.
* **TYPE** - regexPattern is matched against only variables instances OR annotations
* **CONSTRUCT** - regexPattern is matched against only constructor calls
* **IMPORT** - regexPattern is matched against only import calls

###Nested Decorators
Within the windup:java-classification tag, users can chain windup:decorators.  This allows Windup rules to very easily and efficiently filter rules that need to apply to a given resource.  Take the following example:

Within the windup:decorators tag, users can put 0 .. many Windup decorators.

```xml
<windup:java-classification source-type="INHERITANCE" regex="org.mule.umo.UMOFilter$" description="Mule ESB Message Filter">
  <windup:decorators>
    <windup:link url="http://camel.apache.org/message-filter.html" description="Camel Message Filter" />
    <windup:link url="http://camel.apache.org/bean-language.html" description="Camel Message Bean Filter" />
  </windup:decorators>
</windup:java-classification>
```

In the example above, if the Java class extends from a class matching the regular expression "org.mule.umo.UMOFilter$", then the Windup engine applies the nested decorators, within windup:decorators nested tag.  Essentially in the example above, this links to several articles which would help migration from Mule Message Filter to Camel's Message Filter.

This concept is important.  This essentially allows Windup to be extremely efficient by only executing rules that apply to a given classification.  For example, if the Java class is a EJB, you may want to chain other decorators that extract @EJB annotations to extract EJB injection information.  As this only applies to an EJB, this logic would be better handled by a nested decorator so that it only applies the logic in cases where an EJB is identified instead of trying to apply it to every class.


###Nested Hints
Within the windup:java-classification tag, users can chain windup:hints.  This allows Windup rules to very easily and efficiently filter rules that need to apply to a given resource.  

Within the windup:decorators tag, users can put 0 .. many Windup hints.

Take the following example:

```xml
<windup:java-classification source-type="INHERITANCE" regex="((com.ibm.websphere.startupservice.AppStartUpHome)|(com.ibm.websphere.startupservice.AppStartUp)|(com.ibm.websphere.startupservice.ModStartUpHome)|(com.ibm.websphere.startupservice.ModStartUp))$" description="Websphere Startup Service" effort="4">
 <windup:hints>
  <windup:java-hint regex="com.ibm.websphere.startupservice.AppStartUpHome" hint="Replace with EJB 3.1 @Singleton / @Startup annotations."/>
 </windup:hints>
 <windup:decorators>
  ...
 </windup:decorators>
</windup:java-classification>
```

Only in the case that this has been deemed to have the classification of a "Websphere Startup Service" will the hint try to be applied.  This hint will be added inline wherever the class "com.ibm.websphere.startupservice.AppStartUpHome" is used, and will add the hint to "Replace with EJB 3.1 @Singleton / @Startup annotations."
