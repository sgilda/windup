## 5.1 Ten Thousand Foot View
Windup will produce an HTML Report.  The `index.html` is the "10,000" foot view of the application.  This report is the central point which links to all resource reports.  This main report looks to provide overviews of all resources "of interest".  The top of the report displays a graph, collecting all "potential changes" that would need to be modified in the application to provide a quick, high level view of the effort involved in migrating the application.

### Story Points
Story Points are a measure of effort in Agile methodology.  Each team has different skill sets, and those skill sets translate to different levels of effort.  Therefore, Windup presents Story Points, allowing each team to decide how much time to assign per point.  Some teams of very senior resources will find that the Story Points map to "1 hour" each.  Or other teams may find other translations to meet their needs and technical skills.  Also, most teams will find that as they perform one migration, their hours - to - story points ratio will likely drop (since they will be developing skills along the way to increase their migration knowledge and therefore decrease their hours effort moving forward).

The main thing to understand is that Windup adds story points only for things it recognizes.  But, adding and adjusting Story Points associated with each "potential change" is easy with Windup.  In the following sections on Building Rules, we will discuss adding and adjusting Story Points to the Windup output.

### The Pie Graph
At the top of the report, and with each "customer" archive, Windup displays the Pie Graph.  The Pie Graph is a high level summary of the potential changes that must occur to have the application compatible within the target platform.  It is a great way of quickly scanning to say "most of the potential changes are com.weblogic" for example.  If you are running on a proprietary platform, and you don't see the vendor's packages outlined in the Windup report, chances are the effort to migrate is quite low!

### Archive Views
The archive views show each archive in the 10,000 foot view, and describe and link to the resources "of interest" within the report.

As you can see, this view gives a very "scannable" view of areas of interest.  The classifications are helpful to recognize the resources, and each resource's Story Point effort is displayed next to the resource.
