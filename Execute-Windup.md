## Running Windup
First, let's talk about what Windup can run against...

Windup can run against both Source projects, and also Compiled projects.

### Source Projects
There are no prerequisites to run against Source Projects.  Just make sure to include the command line argument `-source true` and point the `-input` parameter at the directory containing your source!  Make sure to include an `output` directory for the Windup Report! 


## Command Line Arguments

* From the command line:  `java -jar windup-cli.jar`
