## Source code & Building
The source code can be cloned from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/windup/windup).

## How can you help?
There are several levels of possible involvement, ranging
1) Providing the apps
2) Identifying the important things and parts difficult to migrate
3) Writing a short description what's the problem with those parts
4) Writing a brief guide how to deal with them
5) Writing an automated Windup rule for them
6) Creating a test for that rule

Any level of involvement will be highly appreciated.
