## Building Windup

To build the project, a patch that is not in the upstream yet is needed. The following step are needed to

* Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/jsight/frames` and run `mvn clean install` on the branch **classloaderresolver**
* Clone the windup `git clone https://github.com/windup/windup` and run `mvn clean package`
* Enjoy!
