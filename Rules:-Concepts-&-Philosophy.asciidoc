Windup is a rule-based tool that allows users to write customized rules
based on the needs, constructs, and custom APIs used in their
applications.

Individual rules should be decoupled, only expressing dependencies on
each other, and "communicate" through the graph. Each rule will query
the graph database, use the results for locating the candidates of it's
interests, process them, and then write the results to the graph
database.

Graph database and Models (Frames)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a graph db implementation, we use http://tinkerpop.com/[TinkerPop]
backed by http://thinkaurelius.github.io/titan/[Titan] backed by
BerkeleyDB. For explanation of graph database concepts, see
https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan/wiki/Beginner%27s-Guide[Titan].

Like there's ORM (like JPA) for JDBC, TinkerPop's BluePrints has
https://github.com/tinkerpop/frames/wiki[Frames]. This allows you to
access the graph data in form of your custom Java models (implemented as
Java Proxies to the querying).

We use this concept heavily. Each ruleset will likely have it's own
models. (But you can opt to use Blueprints API if you like).
