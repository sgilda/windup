### Purpose
This wiki is a place for documentation created collaboratively, a bit wildly, on the fly.
It is intended to reflects the state of the master branch, however pages may get obsolete as master changes quickly.

### Areas
The wiki is divided into these main areas (which may sometimes overlap) and with these prefixes:

* `Dev: ...` = for developers.
* `Rules: ...` = for rules authors.
* No prefix = for users of Windup.

### Mardown, or AsciiDoc, or...?
We will gladly receive newly created pages with valuable information about the project; feel free to use whichever language is your favorite. But when the page is "finished", we will convert it to AsciiDoc.
To prevent that, put "Draft" to the beginning of the page.
