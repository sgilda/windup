This wiki is a place for documentation created collaboratively, a bit wildly, on the fly.
It is intended to reflects the state of the master branch, however pages may get obsolete as master changes quickly.

The wiki is divided into these main areas (which may sometimes overlap) and with these prefixes:

* `Dev: ...` = for developers.
* `Rules: ...` = for rules authors.
* No prefix = for users of Windup.
