= Submit Code Updates to the Windup Project

If you do not yet have a copy of the Windup Source Code, see link:./Dev:-Get-the-Windup-Source-Code[Get the Windup Source Code] for instructions.

1.  Open a command terminal and navigate to the root of the Windup project directory.
2.  Create a new topic branch to contain your features, changes, or
fixes using the `git checkout` command:
+
-----------------------------------------------------
 git checkout -b  <topic-branch-name> upstream/master
-----------------------------------------------------

+
If you are fixing a JIRA, it is a good practice to use the number in the
branch name. For example:
+
----------------------------------------------
    git checkout -b WINDUP-225 upstream/master
----------------------------------------------
3.  Make changes or updates to the source files. Be sure to test the changes thoroughly!
4.  When you are sure your updates are ready and working, use the `git add` command to add new or changed file contents to the
staging area.
+
----------------------
git add <folder-name>/
git add <file-name>
----------------------
5.  Use the `git status` command to view the status of the files in the
directory and in the staging area and ensure that all modified files are
properly staged:
+
------------------
git status        
------------------
6.  Commit your changes to your local topic branch. For example:
+
---------------------------------------------------------
git commit -m 'WINDUP-225: Description of change...'     
---------------------------------------------------------
7.  Push your local topic branch to your GitHub forked repository. This
will create a branch on your GitHub fork repository with the same name as
your local topic branch name.
+
--------------------------------
git push origin HEAD            
--------------------------------
+
_Note: The above command assumes your remote repository is named
'origin'. You can verify your forked remote repository name using the
command `git remote -v`_.
8.  Browse to the newly created branch on your forked GitHub repository.
+
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 https://github.com/<your-username>/windup/tree/<topic-branch-name> 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
9.  Open a Pull Request. For details, see

only the changes you expect.
10.  The pull request will be reviewed and merged by a Windup project administrator.
