Above is an example of an inline hint in an XML file.  Below is the Windup decorator that led to the inline hint.  The windup:xpath-value decorator is used to pinpoint a location within an XML file to target for an inline hint.  The windup:regex-hint then adds the hint to the XML element point-pointed using the XPath expression.

```xml
<windup:xpath-value description="Weblogic Specific"
 xpath="//*[@value='org.hibernate.transaction.WeblogicTransactionManagerLookup']/@value | //property[@name='transaction.manager_lookup_class' and .='org.hibernate.transaction.WeblogicTransactionManagerLookup']/text()"
 effort="1" inline="true">
 <windup:hints>
  <windup:regex-hint regex="org.hibernate.transaction.WeblogicTransactionManagerLookup$" hint="Replace with: org.hibernate.transaction.JBossTransactionManagerLookup"/>
 </windup:hints>
</windup:xpath-value>
```

In the example above, Windup applies the decorator windup:xpath-value to the XML file, and looks for an element with the *value* attribute "org.hibernate.transaction.WeblogicTransactionManagerLookup".  When this is matched, Windup adds the *description* "Weblogic Specific" to the Windup resource report, and highlights the line.

Next, Windup processes all windup:hints.  In this case, the windup:regex-hint applies against the value extracted in the windup:xpath-value decorator.  The inline *hint* "Replace with: org.hibernate.transaction.JBossTransactionManagerLookup" is included with the highlighted line.

##XPath Value
Attributes on the XPath Value include ([windup.xsd](https://github.com/windup/windup/blob/master/windup-engine/src/main/resources/namespace/windup.xsd)):
* **description** (string) - the description of the match
* **xpath** (xpath) - the xpath to match against
* **effort** (int) - number of Story Points to implement estimated changes
* **inline** (int) - whether to include the match inline or at the top of the file as a highlight

###XPath Namespaces
Note that the windup:namespace tag can be used to provide one or more namespace prefix to uri mappings. All namespace prefixes in the xpath expression must have a cooresponding windup:namespace tag.

Nested elements on the XPath Value include:

* **windup:namespace**
* **windup:hints**
* **windup:decorators**

##Regex Hint
Attributes on the Regex Hint include ([windup.xsd](https://github.com/windup/windup/blob/master/windup-engine/src/main/resources/namespace/windup.xsd)):
* **hint** (string) - the inline hint to define the Java if the Regex matches
* **effort** (int) - number of Story Points to implement estimated changes
* **regex** (regex) - regular expression to match against
