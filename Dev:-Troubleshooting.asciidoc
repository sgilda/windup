Logging
^^^^^^^

Logging is currently broken and will not be fixed any soon. If you don't
see any log messages, resort to `System.out.println()`. If you see too
much logging (especially from Forge), get used to it. See also
WINDUP-73.

[[weird-exceptions]]
Weird exceptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Exceptions in Surefire reports are broken due to Forge's way of wrapping
exceptions combined with Surefire's way of handling them. You need to
debug or rewrap using `TestUtil.rewrap(ex)`. See also WINDUP-197.

Classloading problems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It might get tricky to do the dependencies right in Forge-based project.
Check Build:-Dependencies[this wiki] for some hints.
