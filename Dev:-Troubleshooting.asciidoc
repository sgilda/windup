= Troubleshooting Windup

== Logging

Logging is currently broken and will not be fixed any time soon. If you do not
see any log messages, resort to `System.out.println()` for logging. You may also see too
much logging, especially from Forge. This is to be expected. 

For more information about logging, see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WINDUP-73[WINDUP-73].

== Debugging Exceptions

Exceptions in Surefire reports are broken due to the way Forge wraps
exceptions and the way Surefire handles them. You need to
debug or rewrap exceptions using `TestUtil.rewrap(ex)`. 

For more information about exceptions, see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WINDUP-197[WINDUP-197].

== Classloading Problems

Configuring dependencies in a Forge-based project can be a little tricky.
See link:./Dev:-Dependencies[Dev: Dependencies] for some hints.
