1. Go to [Apache Maven Project - Download Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.html) and download the latest distribution for your operating system.
2. See the Maven documentation for information on how to download and install Apache Maven for your operating system.

Windup uses artifacts located in the [JBoss Nexus](http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/) repository. You must configure Maven to use this repository before you build Windup.
