How can you help?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To help us make Windup cover most application constructs and server configurations, including yours, you may try the following, from 5-minute thinking to few days of coding:

* link:http://issues.jboss.com/browse/WINDUP[Tell us] what should Windup migration rules cover.
* Provide example applications to test migration rules.
* Identify components and problem areas that may be difficult to
migrate.
* Write a short description of these problem migration areas.
* Write a brief guide describing how to deal with problem migration
areas.
* Write an Windup rule to automate the migration process.
* Create a test for the new rule.

Any level of involvement is greatly appreciated.
