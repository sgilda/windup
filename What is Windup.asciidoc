JBoss Windup is a tool to simplify application migrations. Running from
a http://forge.jboss.org[Forge] environment, the tool reads EAR, WAR, and
JAR files and produces an HTML report detailing the inner workings of
the Java application to simplify migration efforts. It seeks to make
migrating from other containers to JBoss a piece of cake.

== Windup 2.0 vs. Windup 0.7.x

Windup 2.0 aims to deliver the same functionality as legacy Windup. The
internal architecture, however, link:Architecture[is very different],
and so are link:Rules%20Authoring[the rules].

== How Does Windup Simplify Migration?

Windup is comprised of resource interrogators. These interrogators look
for common resources and highlight technologies and known “trouble
spots” in migrating applications. The goal of Windup is to provide a
high level view into relevant technologies in use within the
application, and provide a consumable report for organizations to
estimate, document, and migrate JEE applications to JBoss.

Below is a list of the interrogators included with JBoss Windup:

[cols="2*", options="header"] 
|===
|Interrogator
|Description

|Java Interrogator
|Reads compiled Java files, determines if blacklisted classes are imported, and if so, continues to profile the resource.

|JSP Interrogator
|Reads JSP files, extracts the JSP imports and taglibs, and continues to
profile the resource

|XML Interrogator
|Reads XML files into a DOM objects and continues to profile the resource.
