JBoss Windup is a tool to simplify application migrations. Running from
a http:forge.jboss.org[Forge] environment, the tool reads EAR, WAR, and
JAR files and produces an HTML report detailing the inner workings of
the Java application to simplify migration efforts. It seeks to make
migrating from other containers to JBoss a piece of cake.

Windup 2.0 vs. Windup 0.7.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Windup 2.0 aims to deliver the same functionality as legacy Windup. The
internal architecture, however, link:Architecture[is very different],
and so are link:Rules%20Authoring[the rules].

How does Windup simplify migrations?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windup is comprised of resource interrogators. These interrogators look
for common resources and highlight technologies and known “trouble
spots” in migrating applications. The goal of Windup is to provide a
high level view into relevant technologies in use within the
application, and provide a consumable report for organizations to
estimate, document, and migrate JEE applications to JBoss.

Below is a list of the interrogators included with JBoss Windup:

Interrogators
Description
Java Interrogator
Reads compiled Java files; determined if blacklisted classes are
imported, and if so it will continue to profile the resource.
JSP Interrogator
Reads JSP files; extracts JSP import and taglibs in use and continues to
profile the resource.
XML Interrogator
Reads XML files; reads the XML into a DOM object and continues to
profile the resource.
